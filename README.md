# My DSA & Problem-Solving Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my public DSA repository. This is my daily logbook as I practice and master Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ to prepare for top-tier technical interviews.

This repository tracks my consistent, daily effort as I transition from learning programming fundamentals to mastering the problem-solving patterns required by the best tech companies.

## My Study Plan & Methodology

My current mission is to master the foundational patterns of problem-solving. To do this, I am following a structured plan:

  * **Primary Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/trueashik)
  * **Study Guide:** The [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) list, which provides a curated path through the most important interview problems.
  * **My "Grind" Schedule:**
    1.  **Daily Practice:** Solve 1-2 new problems from the NeetCode list every day.
    2.  **Spaced Repetition:** Solve all previously-solved problems from the week every Sunday to build long-term memory.
    3.  **Monthly Review:** On the last Sunday of each month, re-solve the hardest problems from that month to ensure the concepts are locked in.

## Tech Stack & Tools

  * **Language:** C++
  * **Core Toolkit:** The C++ Standard Template Library (STL), including `vector`, `map`, `set`, `stack`, `queue`, `priority_queue`, and the `<algorithm>` library.
  * **Automation:** Using [Leethub](https://github.com/QasimWani/LeetHub) to automatically push my "Accepted" LeetCode solutions to this repository.

## Repository Structure

Solutions in this repository are named and organized according to their LeetCode problem number and title.

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_Two_Sum.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ 9_Palindrome_Number.cpp
â”œâ”€â”€ 217_Contains_Duplicate.cpp
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each solution file includes comments at the top explaining the **pattern** used (e.g., Hashing, Two Pointers) and its **Time & Space Complexity**.

## Why Public?

This repository serves two purposes:

1.  As a public commitment to myself to stay consistent and disciplined.
2.  As a "workout log" that demonstrates my journey, my problem-solving skills, and my dedication to potential recruiters and employers.
