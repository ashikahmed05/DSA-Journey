# NeetCode 150 - The Core Interview Patterns

This folder contains my C++ solutions for the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) problem set.

This is a curated list of the 150 most essential LeetCode problems, designed to build a rock-solid foundation in all major Data Structures and Algorithms patterns. My goal here is not just to get an "Accepted" solution, but to deeply understand the **optimal pattern** behind each problem.

## My Methodology

1.  **Attempt:** I first try to solve each problem myself (20-30 minute time limit).
2.  **Learn:** If I get stuck or my solution isn't optimal (e.g., $O(n^2)$ when an $O(n)$ solution exists), I watch the video explanation from NeetCode to learn the pattern.
3.  **Implement:** I write the optimal, efficient solution in C++ from scratch.
4.  **Review:** I re-solve these problems weekly and monthly to ensure the patterns are committed to my long-term memory.
